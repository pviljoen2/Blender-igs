Blender IA/IGS exporter V2.0.158 HenningBR218 2010-04-21

1. Summary
----------
The Blender IA/IGS Exporter 2.0, (Bigex), is a Python Plugin for the very 
powerful 3D modelling and animation suite Blender. Bigex allows the export 
into Kuju's own IA and IGS intermediate formats. These file formats are 
required to import 3D models into Rail Simulator and Rail Works.

    Note: The Blender IA/IGS Exporter version 2.0 does not support the export 
          of animations into the   IA format. This function will be 
          implemented in a later version.

The usage of the Blender IA/IGS export extension Bigex is allowed for creation 
of 3D models only, which are distributed without any form of compensation 
(Freeware). The usage for creation of 3D models which are not distributed as 
Freeware (Payware, Shareware, etc.) requires the express and written approval 
of the author (Contact: henningbr218 (at) b188 (dot) de).

Each 3D model, created with the Blender IA/IGS export extension Bigex, with a 
certain count of vertices gets a special marking. This mark appears later in 
the 3D model in Rail Simulator / Railworks also. The evidence, that a certain 
3D model was created with the Blender IA/IGS export extension Bigex is 
therefore identifiable.

The usage of Bigex is at the users own risk. The Author assumes no liability

person resulting from the use of this script.

3. Further information
----------------------
Further information regarding installation, usage and also detailed background 
information are in the manual (Bogex_Manual.pdf)

    Note: Nearly no one would be able to export a working model for RS/RW 
          without reading the manual. The possibilities for settings in 
          Blender are way to manifold.
